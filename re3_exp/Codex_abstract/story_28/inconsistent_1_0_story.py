## Olivia Dupree's cheeks were stained with tears as she approached the boarding area for the plane to New York.
## Her arms were wrapped around her guardian's waist, and she was clutching her new backpack to her chest.
## She was only four years old, but she had never been away from home before and didn't know why she had to go on this trip.
## "I don't want to go," Olivia whimpered, looking up at her mother's face.
## Amanda knelt down on one knee and embraced her daughter in a tight hug.
## "Olivia, you have to go.
## Your Aunt Payton is very busy and can't take care of you right now," Amanda said softly.
## "I know you're going to like New York."
## Olivia released a loud sob and buried her face in Amanda's shoulder.
## "It'll be okay," Amanda promised her daughter again.
## "You'll stay with your aunt for a few days, get some rest, eat good food-the works!
## I bet it'll be really fun."
## Olivia looked at Amanda and wiped a tear away from the corner of her eye with the back of her hand.
## "Are you coming back?"

## The year is 2023 and the world is in shambles.
## The United States is at war with China and Russia.
## The economy has collapsed, and the government is on the verge of collapse.
## The world is in chaos, and people are struggling to survive.
## In the midst of all this, a new threat emerges.
## A virus has spread across the globe, killing millions of people.
## The virus is highly contagious and has no known cure.
## The government has declared a state of emergency, and the president has ordered all citizens to stay in their homes for the next two weeks.
## In the midst of all this, a young woman named Olivia Dupree is trying to survive.
## She has been living on the streets for the past few months, and she is desperate to find a way to get home to her family in New York.
## She has heard rumors that there is a vaccine that can cure the virus, but she doesn't know where to find it.
## She is also worried about her parents, who are both sick with the virus.
## She is determined to find a way to get home to them, but she doesn't know how.
## As she wanders the streets, she sees a man sitting on a bench.
## He is wearing a suit and tie, and he has a briefcase in his lap.
## She approaches him cautiously, but he doesn't seem to notice her.
## "Excuse me, sir," she says.
## "Do you know where I can find a vaccine for the virus?"
## The man looks up at her and smiles.
## "Why yes, I do," he says.
## "It's being developed by the government, but it's not ready yet."
## "How do you know?" she asks.
## "I work for the government," he says.
## "I'm a scientist."
## "Oh," she says.
## "Can you help me?"
## "I'm afraid not," he says.
## "I'm working on it right now, but it won't be ready for another month or so."
## "A month?" she says.
## "That's too long!"
## "I'm sorry," he says.
## "I wish I could help you, but I can't."
## "Please," she says.
## "My parents are sick, and I need to get home to them."
## "I'm sorry," he says again.
## "I can't help you."
## "Why not?" she asks.
