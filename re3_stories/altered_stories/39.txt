Connor Riley sat in the shuttle craft, feeling uneasy. He was scheduled to be the pilot of the Mars expedition and should have been excited about that, but he wasn't. He had not been consulted about the makeup of the rest of the team, and he didn't know why he felt so uneasy about that either. The mission was all about searching for signs of life on Mars, and Dr. Harper was a plant biologist. There was no point having a doctor if they weren't going to look for signs of life there. And he knew from his own research that any planets that had enough water would also support life on them at some point in their history.

"The Earth isn't an exception," Connor told himself quietly while tapping his fingers on his thigh nervously. He really wasn't looking forward to being stuck in a small space with four other people for a six-month flight to Mars, but one person in particular worried him even more than anyone else on the team: Nadia Kaminski.

Nadia's field of expertise was astrobiology, so why had she been chosen? Unless someone knew something she didn't know!
