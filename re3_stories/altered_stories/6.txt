Jillian Riley couldn't believe her sister was actually moving to the city.

"I've finally found my dream job," said Shannon. "I'm going to be a journalist."

"That's great, sis," said Jillian, smiling. "But how are you going to pay the rent? I hope you know you don't have a job lined up yet. There are no newspapers in town, so it won't be easy finding a job."

"But I have found a job!" exclaimed Shannon. "Robert Riley hired me."

Jillian choked on her soup. "What?" she asked incredulously when she'd recovered herself. "You're not going to work for Robert Riley!" Jillian knew her father had moved back to the city about three months ago, but she didn't know he'd gotten back into journalism after retiring many years ago. Apparently, Shannon hadn't known either. She just assumed that Robert had moved back to the city and was living off his retirement fund while taking care of his two granddaughters full-time.
