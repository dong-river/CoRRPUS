Karen Hartman sat on her bed, absentmindedly picking at a loose thread in the bedspread. She watched Nina work away on a school project, scowling at the pieces of paper Nina was spread out on her bed. It was late afternoon, and Karen wanted to just lay back and relax for a few minutes before she went home. Instead, she was stuck in her room helping her friend who wasn't exactly an expert when it came to organization.

Nina paused in her work and looked up at Karen. "Is something wrong?"

"No. I'm fine." Karen lied. Nina didn't fall for it.

"Don't lie to me." She said flatly before getting up and turning away from Karen so that she couldn't see the hurt in her eyes. "It's about the fifth time you've gotten off my bed today." There was a long silence before Nina continued to speak again without turning around. "If you want me to leave you alone, just say so." Her voice was barely above a whisper as tears stung her eyes.
