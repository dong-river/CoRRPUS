Mark Woodbury hurried down the sidewalk and crossed the street. He didn’t have time to be late for his date with Shannon Kincaid, and he wanted to arrive at the restaurant early so he could beat the rush. As he neared the entrance, he saw her waving at him from a table inside.

“I’m sorry I’m late, Mark,” she said when he sat down. “I was held up in traffic on the way here. How are you?”

Mark leaned over and kissed her cheek. “That was quite a jolt you gave me when you called a few minutes ago and said you were running late. But I guess it’s good that I got here when I did. If we had set this thing for any later, we would have missed our reservation for sure. They were about to turn people away as I walked up here.”

Shannon laughed lightly.
