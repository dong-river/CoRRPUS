Grace Walsh was in the middle of showing a potential buyer around a client's house when her phone rang. Glancing at it, she saw the number was blocked, so she declined it and put the phone back in her pocket.

A minute later it rang again, so she accepted the call and put it on speaker. "Hello?" She asked as she walked out of the bathroom and into the living room. The buyer was looking around intently at some marks on the floor where a rug used to be and seemed not to notice her momentary absence.

"I think you should come home right now," said a soft voice on the other end of the line. Grace's blood ran cold as she recognized it immediately: Mallory Walsh's voice was unmistakable. Her little girl sounded upset and near tears; that must mean there was something wrong with Brendan or something awful had happened to them both! Grace's heart started pounding wildly in her chest.

"I can't, I'm at work right now," Grace said as calmly as possible so Mallory wouldn't be afraid, "Where are you? Is Daddy with you?" Silence greeted her on the other end of the line for several moments before Mallory finally spoke again.
