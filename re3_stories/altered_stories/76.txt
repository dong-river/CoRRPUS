Jason Westfall sits on the floor, looking at the empty box that used to hold his sister-in-law's belongings. His gaze is unfocused, his eyes brimming with tears. He cries for hours, eventually falling asleep from exhaustion. When he wakes up, he feels dazed and ill.

Joan died in a car accident on a rainy day several weeks ago. She was coming home from work when she had a seizure behind the wheel and her car veered off the road and crashed into a tree. The doctors said she died instantly.

Jason has been carrying on with life ever since as best he can manage, but he still doesn't really know how to cope with Joan's death. He didn't get along very well with her while she was alive and they only saw each other rarely; it never seemed like a real loss when he lost touch with her completely years ago. But now he feels utterly alone without her and desperately misses having someone in his life who cared about him and whom he could care about in return.
