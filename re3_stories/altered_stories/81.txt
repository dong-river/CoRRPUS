Jenna Marcoshka didn't want to admit it, but she was dreading school the next day. In the middle of her sophomore year, her best friend Cathy had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. A little more than a year later, and Cathy could barely see ten feet in front of her. She had trouble walking in a straight line and would bump into obstacles often. The doctors told Jenna and her family that there was nothing that could be done, and that it was just a matter of time before Cathy would lose all of her sight.

Jenna and Cathy had always been best friends, spending every second they could together after school until Jenna's mom picked her up on the bus at five o'clock every afternoon. Jenna remembered those days well; playing video games, swimming in their pool during the summer months and sledding down hills on winter days. Things were different now though; Mark's schedule was constantly changing as he was constantly trying to make more money to try to keep their house from being foreclosed on while he kept them going as they always tried to pay off bills with not much money coming in most months.
