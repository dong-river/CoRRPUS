George McCarthy's wife had been murdered. In a grotesque final act, her killer left her body in the bathroom in their house, blood staining the tiles of the floor, coating the pale walls in a dark shade of red.

“You should come home with me, Shannon,” George McCarthy said to his seven-year-old daughter. “Your grandmother is coming to pick you up any minute now.”

Shannon shook her head as she continued to gaze out of the window at the view of their small yard and the leafy trees beyond. She had stopped paying attention to what her father was saying some time ago and was only vaguely aware that he was sitting beside her on his daughter's bed and trying his best to comfort her through what he knew must be a traumatic experience for a young girl such as herself. Although Evelyn McCarthy had been Shannon's mother and shared 50% of her genes, it wasn't quite accurate to say that Shannon was grieving for Evelyn—not yet anyway—because right now she could barely remember who her mother was or what she looked like. Still, she knew it wasn't normal for a child not to cry when they lost their mother.
