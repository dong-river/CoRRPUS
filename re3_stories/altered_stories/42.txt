Carl Russo parked his car in front of the police station, excited to tell his coworker and friend, John Davis, about a television show he was watching. The show was called 'Police Intervention', and its goal was to catch police officers on camera during a routine traffic stop who were unfairly profiling.

"Hey, Davis!" Carl shouted as he burst through the front door of the police station.

John waved at Carl from across the room. He stopped talking to the other cops and turned around to face Carl as he approached him. "Hey Russo," John said with a big smile on his face. "You're in a good mood today!"

Carl dropped his things on his desk and looked at John curiously. "I have good news! And I know you'll appreciate it." He nodded at one of the other cops nearby and laughed when that cop made fun of him for going to UCLA instead of California State University at Northridge. They all shared some good-natured laughs together before they turned back towards Carl and John when they heard Carl's next sentence; "I watched this great TV show last night called 'Police Intervention'."

"What's that?" one of the young rookie cops asked. "Like COPS?"
