Porter Haggerty was sitting at his desk, editing photos that he had taken of a violent protest. There were several close-up shots of protestors fighting with police officers, as well as several overhead photos showing a large crowd of people running through the streets.

Porter was one of the top photographers in the city, and he felt proud to be doing important work. Every time he captured an interesting image with his camera, he felt like a reporter who had stumbled across an amazing story. Porter was always looking for an inspiring photo to capture.

As Porter sat at his desk, editing photos, the newspaper's CEO stormed into the room and stood in front of him.

“Look at this garbage!” CEO Miller snapped angrily, pointing to a stack of papers on Porter's desk. “Why is it so dull?”

Porter took a deep breath and carefully composed himself before responding. He knew that it was vital to show CEOs that they couldn't intimidate him or put him off balance by yelling at him – especially not a difficult boss like CEO Miller. Unfortunately, several other young journalists on staff were scared of him and put their work aside whenever he visited their desks to give them assignments or reprimands.
