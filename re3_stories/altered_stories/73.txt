Lucas Darnell, a six-year-old boy, got into the car. "Are we there yet?" he asked his parents.

"Not yet, sweetie," said his mother.

"Are we almost there?" Lucas asked again.

His father looked at him in the rear view mirror. "When will we be there, Lucas?"

"We'll be there when we get there," said Lucas with a big smile on his face. Lucas was an inquisitive boy who loved playing and learning new things. His favorite subject in school was math and he would often ask his parents questions about it after school was over for the day. He had no worries in life and often found things like grocery shopping to be very exciting because he would see new foods that he hadn't seen before and he could even try some of them out with their family meals that night, which of course always made him feel proud of himself for being a food critic as well as getting to eat something new to try out himself as well.
