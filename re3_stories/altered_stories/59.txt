Landon Shaw stood over the metal table, his stethoscope on and his head bent down to listen to the heart of the dead girl lying before him. He was 30 years old and wore a black coat over a crisp white shirt and tie. His hair was short and spiky on top, like he had just walked out of a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it. He turned to the nurse next to him, a pretty brunette with a tight ponytail.

"Could you write that down for me?" Landon asked her, referring to her notepad where she had written down what he said about the body on the table in front of them. "Could you tell me again what she said?"

The nurse shrugged, pointing back at Landon with her pen. "You were there."

Landon rolled his eyes and returned his attention to the body lying before him. The only body he'd been able to work on since Payton's accident almost one year ago; something he felt immensely guilty about but couldn't seem to control. Payton was his fianc√©, not even wife yet and now she's gone for good just as he got that promise ring on her finger.
