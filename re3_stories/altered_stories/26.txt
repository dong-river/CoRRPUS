Karen Hanson was having a hard time finding her aunt Lettie. She tried calling several times, but she wasn't answering her phone. She didn't want to bother Bob and Mary, so she decided to drive over to the Hanson residence.

When Karen arrived at the house, no one answered the door. "How can this be?" she thought to herself. "It's way too early for them to go out for the day." Suddenly she got an idea. She went around back and climbed in through a window in Bob's workshop where they would often play tricks on each other and say they wouldn't lock it when they left. (The door had been jammed ever since Bob's last attempt.) Karen was sure that was where Lettie would be right now. She burst into the room and found Lettie curled up on the bed sobbing. When she looked up, Karen saw that her eyes were blackened and red from crying so much.

"What happened?" asked Karen frantically as she came running over to sit down next to her aunt on the bed. "I've been trying to call you all morning!"
