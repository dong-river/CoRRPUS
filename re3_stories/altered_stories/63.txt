James Walters is in the local library when he sees the flier for the upcoming historical society tour of the Bell mansion. He has just arrived in town to visit his sister, Rebecca, and is interested in learning more about their new town. When he learns that some of the treasures from the Bell family are to be put on display at the opening, he is excited and makes sure to get tickets.

Rebecca Walters was upset when she found out that her brother was going to visit her unexpectedly but she is even more upset when she learns that he bought tickets for an historical society event. She can't stand history or anything to do with it and doesn't understand why he would waste his money on such a pointless event. She begins to worry what people will think if they show up together, two single people with no real reason for being in town all of a sudden except for this historical society nonsense.

Jessica Bell knows how much the opening is going to mean to Rebecca and wants her friend's last week before moving away from home as stress free as possible. So, despite her hesitations, Jessica agrees to help Rebecca clean out some old trunks in preparation for opening night of tours of the house.
