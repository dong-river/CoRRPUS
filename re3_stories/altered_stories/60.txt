John Kenny lived in the town of Columbia in New Jersey with his parents, who were very wealthy. He was born on September 30th, 1979, and started school at 6 years old. By the time he turned ten he was a member of a scouting troop and his first name was now John-Claude. John loved video games. When he turned 12 years old he received his first gaming console as a birthday present from his parents, and ever since then has been hooked on video games. When John turned 14 years old he met Jake Ryan for the first time through a mutual friend at school called Fred Wolfe. Jake and John became friends, who liked to get together every Friday night and play video games together all night long until 1:00 am the next morning. They got along very well because they had many things in common, like their shared love of action films and their love of playing video games together on Friday nights. John soon got over his fear of entering into fights with other boys when he became older because Jake always stood up for him if anyone ever tried to hurt him, because Jake wasnâ€™t afraid to fight if it meant protecting his friends.
