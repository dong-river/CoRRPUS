Jürgen Meier was exhausted. He had been working at his magazine, CARPET, for over twenty years. He started out as an intern at the magazine and was promoted to editor-in-chief shortly after he finished his degree in journalism. Now, almost thirty years later, he was the owner of a successful company and still going strong with the business. The magazine was one of the top magazines in all of Europe and he ran it with a firm hand.

He had just come back from a business trip where he met with new advertisers for the magazine. As soon as he got back to the office he sent his assistant out for some coffee, hoping that some strong coffee would help him wake up. While waiting for his assistant to come back with the coffee, he sat down at his desk and flipped through all of the memos that had been piling up while he was away on his trip. It was amazing how quickly things could pile up while you were away!

As soon as Jürgen started going through everything on his desk, which he never did during business hours, Tatiana Baranova came into his office to talk about an important marketing campaign they were planning on running in several weeks' time that she felt would not work unless certain changes were made.
