Anna Harris knocks on the door to her daughter's apartment.

“Come in,” a voice calls out. Anna turns the knob and enters. Kaitlyn Harris is in the living room. Anna takes a seat on the couch next to her daughter.

“Hi, Mom,” Kaitlyn says brightly. “What brings you by?” Anna gives her daughter a sad smile and replies, “I came by to talk to you about something that happened earlier today at work, but I also want to talk about something that happened years ago. We need to have an important conversation, so it's best if we go out for coffee or tea or something like that instead of staying here and being distracted by your daily routine. Can we go for coffee? I can't handle talking about these things over your dirty dishes.”

Kaitlyn shifts in her seat awkwardly, not sure how to respond to her mother's request for them to leave their home for the sake of convenience. “Okay, I guess that would be better than staying here for this discussion,” she finally replies softly.
