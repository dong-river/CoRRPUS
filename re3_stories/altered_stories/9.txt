Beth Christensen sat down in a chair across from Julie and took her hand. "You have to listen to me," she said. "You're having the baby."

"Beth, no, no, no! You don't understand," Julie protested. "It's impossible."

"Why?" Beth replied. "Is it because you're still a virgin?"

Julie looked at her friend with tears in her eyes and nodded. "How can I be pregnant? How can that happen?"

"Because you had sex," Beth replied. "You know how it happens, right? The same way every time." She paused for a moment, and then asked softly, "Does he know? Has he spoken to you yet?" She then held up a hand to stop Julie from responding before continuing. "Listen, my advice is that you talk to him about this. Tell him what's going on and see what he says about it."
