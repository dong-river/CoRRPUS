Martha Greenwood has lived in the small town near the river all her life. One day when she was younger, she saw a truck pulling out a bulldozer to cut down the trees in the forest. She knew that this would have bad consequences for the fish, so she planted trees all over town to bring back to life what had been taken away from her.

Esther Greenwood, Martha's granddaughter, is a smart young girl who lives in the town by the river with her father and grandmother. At Esther's school, there is an after-school program for kids who want to start up business ventures. This is where Esther comes up with an idea for a fish farm in town's swimming pool after hearing about environmental problems from her mother when she was at home one day while Esther was at school and heard this on television.

When her parents ask how much money it will cost to convert the swimming pool into a fish farm, Esther says "$400 should be enough."
