Olivia Dupree's cheeks were stained with tears as she approached the boarding area for the plane to New York. Her arms were wrapped around her guardian's waist, and she was clutching her new backpack to her chest. She was only four years old, but she had never been away from home before and didn't know why she had to go on this trip.

"I don't want to go," Olivia whimpered, looking up at her mother's face. Amanda knelt down on one knee and embraced her daughter in a tight hug.

"Olivia, you have to go. Your Aunt Payton is very busy and can't take care of you right now," Amanda said softly. "I know you're going to like New York." Olivia released a loud sob and buried her face in Amanda's shoulder. "It'll be okay," Amanda promised her daughter again. "You'll stay with your aunt for a few days, get some rest, eat good food-the works! I bet it'll be really fun."
