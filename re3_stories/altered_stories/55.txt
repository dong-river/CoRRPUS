Olivia Saunders woke up in the middle of the night. She could hear footsteps outside her room, and so she slowly got out of bed.

"Liv? What are you doing?" asked her sister, Emma. "It's the middle of the night."

"I heard something," said Olivia in a hushed voice.

Emma grabbed her sister's hand and opened her bedroom door, "If you heard something, I want to hear it too," she said.

Olivia was about to say that there was nothing out there, but when she stepped into the hallway, she froze. She felt as if something wasn't right and so they slowly walked down the stairs, towards their parents' room. The footsteps that they heard were coming from there. Their dad's light was on and Olivia saw a strange shadow moving behind their parents' open door.

"Dad?" Emma whispered through the door after knocking on it lightly. They waited for an answer, but none came; they pushed open the door and rushed into their parent's room to see that their dad was gone! He had disappeared in his sleep while it happened to be the middle of the night!
