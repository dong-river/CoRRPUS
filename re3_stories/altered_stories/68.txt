Tom's in his mid-twenties. He's a good friend of John's, who's also in his mid-twenties like he is. John just started dating Christine, who's in her early forties. Tom went to the movies with them last night and enjoyed himself a lot, but he feels like something might go wrong between John and Christine and worries about his friend getting hurt. He wants to protect him.

John is happy with Christine, but doesn't feel exactly at ease being in an older woman's apartment where he's staying overnight. It doesn't seem right to him that an older woman would want to be with a much younger man like him. She doesn't look too old at all, though. She looks like she's in her early thirties or late twenties or something like that. He's not sure why she'd want to be with him when there are probably lots of other men out there that she could be with if she really wanted someone in their early twenties.
