Owen Murphy opened the door to his sister's bedroom and looked inside. "Amelia, why do you have your door locked?"

"I'm busy, Owen," Amelia replied. "Just go away."

"Why is your door locked?" Owen repeated. "What are you doing in there?"

"That's none of your business," Amelia replied. "Just go away."

Owen walked into the room and sat down on Amelia's bed. "I need to know why you're locking your door when you get into this room." He took a deep breath and said, "Is it because I've been asking about Jacob again?" He started crying and fell back onto the bed. "Is that it? Are you scared of me now? You think I'll do something to you if I find out about Jacob?" Owen got up from the bed and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Amelia opened her bedroom door and looked at him as he ran out of their house and across the street to her best friend, Joey Silva's house. He knocked on Joey's door frantically, tears streaming down his face. Joey opened his front door and saw Owen crying on his doorstep.
