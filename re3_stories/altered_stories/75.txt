Gabe McCarthy was always proud of his daughter Jenna. She was a tall and beautiful woman, with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. But she had a darkness about her that made her seem like a completely different person than the rest of the family. He couldn't put his finger on it, but it had always been there.

From a young age, Jenna wanted to become an athlete, which was strange because she was the first in her family to do so. Her brother Garrett had always been the star of their small hometown, earning more college scholarships than anyone else and even being accepted into the military on a grant. Garrett's death in Afghanistan only strengthened Jenna's desire to make her family proud, no matter what it took.

Gabe took pride in being able to provide for his family by working at least 80 hours a week at his auto shop. But he hadn't been able to save much money because he'd had to pay for Garrett's college expenses and medical bills following his war injuries. With another mouth to feed – Jenna – money was tight in their house and she needed something else to bring home some extra cash or they might lose everything they had worked so hard for over the years.
