Charles Wilson sits in his office filling out reports. He's in his forties, in good shape, and has short black hair. His wife is out shopping. She thinks he's at work but instead he's sitting at his desk daydreaming about the girl he's been dating for the past few weeks. She's a college student and is twenty years younger than him but Charles doesn't care. As long as she has a pulse she can have him.

He fantasizes about taking her to dinner tomorrow night and ending up back at her place to have sex. He thinks about bending her over, putting it in doggy style, pounding away until she moans. He thinks about pounding her until she screams for mercy, begging him to stop with tears streaming down her face...

"Good afternoon Charles." His sergeant calls from the doorway of his office waking him from his fantasy. "Just wanted to let you know we just got a rape case down on the South side."

"Great!" Charles said sarcastically with a sigh. "When do I get my vacation?" His sergeant laughs as he walks away leaving Charles alone with his fantasies again.
