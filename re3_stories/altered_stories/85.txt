Bradley Douglas was a member of a special government agency that employed people with superpowers. His ability to control earth enabled him to manipulate the earth at will, including the ability to move stone and metal through the air. He moved these materials at high speeds that caused them to become deadly projectiles. He also had the ability to give the earth an aura of invulnerability, protecting his team members from all attacks until he had finished fighting for them.

Bradley’s sister, Karen Douglas, had moved in with his family after a terrorist attack destroyed her house and killed her parents. She was able to control electricity and create energy blasts from her hands. Together, Bradley and Karen worked as partners against criminals who posed threats to society.

Karen always called him by his given name, Brad. It made Bradley feel slightly uncomfortable when she did this, even though he was only two years older than she was. Although he didn’t mind the physical aspects of Karen calling him by his given name, it never seemed like she respected him as much as she respected everyone else in the agency who she called by their surnames or by their code names instead of their given names when addressing them face-to-face with other agents present.
