Richard Kline is at home with a fever and has been having trouble breathing. His mom brings him an ice pack, but it is not helping to relieve his symptoms. She brings him back to bed and helps him put on his pajamas. He starts to cough and Richard is struggling to catch his breath. He collapses, going unconscious and turning blue.

Jane rushes in to call 911 while Sarah yells for her mom from her bedroom door. She starts yelling "Mother! Mother!" as she runs downstairs, afraid that Richard might die before their mother can save him. But, Sarah Kline is frozen in fear, terrified that something bad will happen if she approaches her brother's room herself. When her mother enters the room again and finds Richard unconscious on the floor, Sarah runs back into her bedroom and closes the door behind her. Jane calls for Sarah and pleads with her to help save Richard from suffocating on his own spit-up but she stays hidden away in her room, paralyzed by fear until after it is too late...
