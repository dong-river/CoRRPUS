Diana Porter is struggling to make ends meet. She is just divorced and she must keep up the payments on her house, even though her ex-husband pays none of the mortgage. The only time she gets a break from the constant stress is when she's at work or when she is out on dates with new boyfriends.

Diana has been trying to make friends in town, but so far it's been difficult. People tend to shy away from Diana since she is new in town and because of her demanding job as a nurse at the local hospital. Diana sometimes feels that people are more likely to befriend Melissa instead of her, but perhaps that's simply because Melissa makes more time for them than Diana does with her hectic schedule.

Diana's life changes for the better when Mark sees his kids for what may be the last time if he doesn't get out of jail soon, which leads him to decide that he can't let it end this way between them.
