Jessica Brown woke up at her usual time. Today was Saturday, which meant she could sleep in. But something was not right. She sat up in bed and glanced around the room.

"What is going on?" she thought to herself. The room was identical to how it had been last night. It seemed to be unchanged except for her sister Jane's side of the room, which looked like a bomb had hit it. Clothes and books were scattered all over the floor, as if there had been a windstorm, while Jane slept on peacefully as though nothing was wrong, unaware of the havoc that had occurred just hours earlier.
