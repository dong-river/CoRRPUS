John Doe is a producer of an up-and-coming band. He is sitting in his home office, his favorite place to be. The room is a wood and glass interior with a patio that overlooks the lake. As he sits in his comfortable chair looking out the window, John thinks about how much he loves music and everything it has given him. The love of music was one of the things that brought him and Janet together 15 years ago.

He was working at RCA Records at the time. He had just been promoted to marketing director and put together a performance by an obscure indie band that would prove to be incredibly successful. After much urging by him, Janet attended the show with him and became swept up in the energy of the crowd and now knows every word to their best song. This was not just any group but Young Love (Youth). Since then their fan base has skyrocketed due to their more than positive response to pop culture references like beer ads, blogs, tweets, websites and YouTube videos.
