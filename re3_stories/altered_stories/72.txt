Martha Gentry, the sister-in-law of Robert Gentry, stood on the porch outside her bedroom window and waved to Dr. Lewis as he drove away from the farm. She then went back into her bedroom and sat down on the edge of her bed. As she reached for a tissue to wipe away her tears, she noticed that Robert wasn't in his usual place at the head of his bed.

When she reached for the reading lamp, she noticed a piece of paper on the table next to her bed. She picked it up and read it: I'm sorry, Martha. I couldn't do it anymore. I don't know what's wrong with me but I just can't do it anymore, so please forgive me. R



Martha cried as she read what he had written to her; he must have been feeling very bad in order to write such a letter as this one was just not like him at all; however, when Martha came to where he apologized and asked for forgiveness, she couldn't help but smile because that's just how he was—he always wanted everyone to be happy around him and would do anything if it meant that they were happy—even if they weren't happy at his expense.
