Jessica Parker looked at her daughter Sarah through the rearview mirror and marveled at how much the girl had grown in the past year. Her silky brown hair was tied in a ponytail and she was wearing jeans, sneakers, and a bright green t-shirt that made her eyes look even bluer than usual. She also sported braces on her teeth and could drive now, but with some difficulty since Jessica still didn't have a very good car. At least she was old enough to go out for coffee with friends and Sarah loved her friends. The girl had finally adjusted to her new life since Jessica's divorce from William Jensen, which happened about nine months ago. She hadn't seen or heard from him since then.

The divorce wasn't entirely unexpected, but it had come as quite a shock when Jessica found out how much money he made as a businessman. She knew he must have earned some money because he came from an affluent family and was enrolled in an expensive prep school that only admitted boys who had been accepted at Ivy League colleges. As such, he didn't have to worry about going to college because his family would pay for it anyway; and he could spend most of his time partying instead of focusing on his studies.
