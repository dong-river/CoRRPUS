Emma Woods sat in her bedroom glancing at her cell phone. It was 11:30 p.m. on a school night, and Kaitlyn was still awake doing homework.

Kaitlyn had always been a pretty good student, and she worked hard to get good grades. She wanted to go to an Ivy League school when she graduated from high school and become a doctor or a researcher.

But lately, Kaitlyn had been working too hard to get the grades she wanted. She didn't seem to have much time for herself anymore, which made Emma worry about her daughter's well-being. She knew that spending so much time on work could actually make someone sick sometimes. But what could she do? There was no way Emma could push Kaitlyn harder without the risk of creating problems at home that would only make Kaitlyn even more unhappy and stressed out than she already was, so Emma decided to go talk with her daughter instead.

Emma found Kaitlyn at her desk doing homework while listening to some music on her headphones and eating a snack from one of the refrigerators downstairs in the kitchen (Emma hadn't checked what kind of snack it was).
