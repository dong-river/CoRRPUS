Richard Kane glanced at his watch, frowning. His daughter's bedtime was rapidly approaching, and he had yet to settle the kid down. When she wasn't having trouble falling asleep, she was up before dawn and running through the house. She and her brother had little interest in television. He suspected that their mother was mostly responsible for that. Olivia rarely watched any shows with them in front of the screen, and their father didn't bother trying to convince her otherwise.

He rose from his seat at the table with a sigh and glanced around the room. He spotted his wife by one of the large picture windows, staring out at the backyard with a pensive expression on her face. She hadn't moved since he had last spoken to her, an hour ago at least.

He moved towards her and touched her shoulder, then turned towards their youngest child. "Bring Jack into your room," he said quietly before returning his attention to Olivia.

She turned to him slowly, nodding without a word before heading towards their son's bedroom with Jack trotting behind her cheerfully.
