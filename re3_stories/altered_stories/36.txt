Julia Fletcher had been the only person to witness the murder of her daughter-in-law Karen on that fateful day in February. Ever since then, she has been on a constant watch for Karen's ghost and sees her shadow sometimes. The doctors say that she is suffering from hallucinations due to her condition. But every time she sees it, her health seems to worsen drastically. On one fine day when she started convulsing, no one could do anything about it except for the nurse who has been working with Julia for the past four years.

“She might be seeing things!”

“I can see my daughter in this mirror! Why is my body shaking? Is this a fit? It feels like I am shaking all over and I can't control myself! Why am I talking like this? Am I speaking without a tongue or without feeling a mouth?” She sobbed while clutching her chest at the same time. A jolt of fear ran through everyone who was witnessing Julia's state at that time, including Karen's daughter Kate who was trying to give comfort to her mother-in-law.
