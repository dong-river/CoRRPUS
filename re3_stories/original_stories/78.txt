Tim Kincaid is angry with his son, Tommy. His son is misbehaving yet again. This time, he stole a box of dog biscuits and fed them to a neighbor's cat!

"Tim, is this true?" Sarah asks her husband. "Tommy would never do such a thing!"

"The neighbors saw him take the box," Tim says. "We can't keep this boy under control!"

"But Tim," Sarah begins to protest. She wants to argue that her son would never do such a thing. He was only in the yard trying to get Mr. Jones' cat to chase him! But Tommy has been behaving badly and she knows it's best not to defend him right now or Tim will get angrier. "How can we help Tommy?" she asks instead.
