John Kenny had seen a lot of change in his lifetime. He was born in the mid 1950s when people were much more conservative and not as willing to speak their minds. He had served in the army and witnessed the Vietnam War, seen all sorts of tragedies on the news and around the world. Now he was approaching retirement, had a lot of experience behind him, and a lot more to come.

That’s why it was so upsetting for him to be outed this way.

It started when George was turned away from the local hospital for being gay. George was best friends with Ron (despite how their parents felt about that) who came running into John’s shop claiming that his father had been thrown out of town by Mr. Caspar, one of the elders in town, due to some supposed “crimes” he committed while serving his country. John took that chance to put himself in front of everyone with another secret- he wasn’t really Ron’s father at all; Mr. Caspar had been George’s friend since high school but didn’t want anyone to know they were together so they raised him as their son together as a single parent couple.
