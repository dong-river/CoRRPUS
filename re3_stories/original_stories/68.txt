Tom moves out of the house he shared with Christine after he has an affair with his secretary. He's in his late thirties and a successful businessman.

Christine is in her early forties and is a businesswoman who runs her own consulting firm. She had always suspected that Tom was cheating on her, but when she finds out that he has been, she feels blindsided and betrayed.

Christine moves into a new apartment that has a balcony overlooking the bay. She's happy about the move because it signifies her independence from Tom.

John is Christine's new boyfriend, who lives across the hall from her in the apartment building. He's in his early twenties and is an aspiring actor who works at a coffee shop on the weekends to make extra money for acting classes.
