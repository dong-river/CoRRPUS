Harold Martinez works at the gas station as a clerk. He works every night, from 10pm to 7am. He is a middle-aged Hispanic man with dark brown hair, dark eyes, and a medium build. Tonight was supposed to be a quiet night shift, with few customers visiting the gas station.

The shift started on time at 10pm and there were no customers during the first hour. Then at around 11:45pm, there was a customer who walked into the gas station with bags under his eyes. He seemed to be disheveled and his hair was messy. His clothes were dirty and he looked like he hadn’t shaved in days. As he looked at Harold, his eyes seem ed like they haven’t seen the light of day for weeks; they look dead somehow. When he walked up to Harold and said "give me all your money," it took a moment for Harold to process what the man said because the voice that came out was not the one he expected to hear. Instead of hearing an angry or aggressive voice, what came out of this man's mouth is monotone and flat like there's no emotion behind it."I'm sorry," Harold said immediately after processing what happened."I'm not joking around!
