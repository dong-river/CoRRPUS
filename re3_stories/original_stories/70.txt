Anna Harris had spent a great deal of time with ghosts, but she had never encountered one quite like this one.

It was nighttime and she was sitting in a rocking chair. The room was dark and the only light came from a nearby fireplace. She stared into the flames, focusing on them and thinking about everything that had happened to her that day. Kaitlyn had just told her about the new apartment, Ben had proposed to Kaitlyn, Anna's younger sister was now engaged, and Anna herself was still single. Anna knew that Kaitlyn would be moving out soon; there was no reason for her to stay in an apartment where Ben would be moving in with his fiancée. But somehow Anna couldn't picture Kaitlyn as someone's wife—she didn't think of her sister as being quite old enough for something like that. In any case, once Kaitlyn moved out there would be an empty bedroom at home for Anna's ghostly lodger to move into.

Anna turned her head so she could look down the hall at the kitchen table, where she could just make out some strange objects lined up across it: ceramic horses with creepy glazed eyes and ceramic bottles filled with green liquid.
