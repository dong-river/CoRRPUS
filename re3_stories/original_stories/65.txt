Richard Kline arrives home to find that the living room is a mess. He says, "What happened here?"

Sarah comes into the room and says, "Oh, Dad, I was playing with Amy and we spilled juice on the carpet!"

"It looks like more than juice," Richard says.

"I can clean it up," Sarah offers.

Richard is concerned about the cleanup but more concerned about Sarah's behavior. "You know better than to leave a mess like this." Sarah looks ashamed. Richard continues, "Is your friend coming back? Because if she isn't..." His words are lost as he disappears into the next room and heads for his office. Sarah has not heard her father's last sentence because she has darted up to her room, where she crawls under her covers and stays there until she hears her mother calling that dinner is ready. She takes a shower before joining her family at the table, because it gives her an excuse not to look at her parents or speak to them without fidgeting or stuttering.
