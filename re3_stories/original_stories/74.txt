John Doe, an up-and-coming painter, is struggling with a difficult decision. His career is taking off, and his paintings are selling well. At the same time, he is trying to decide whether to start another series of paintings that he feels passionate about. The work involves detailed renderings of clouds. Clouds, you ask?
