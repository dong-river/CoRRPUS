Thomas Watkins squinted as he surveyed the darkness surrounding the small town. He and his team had been in place for almost twenty-four hours, so they were all getting tired. They'd searched the town thoroughly, but they hadn't been able to find any sign of the killer. It was driving them crazy, but there wasn't much they could do except watch and wait.

Thomas was a big man with brown hair and brown eyes. He stood at 6'2" and had a muscular build. He normally worked as a construction worker, but he also moonlighted as a mercenary on nights like this one. His skills were in high demand among local towns that needed help protecting themselves from violent criminals or people that wanted to invade their territory or business interests. Thomas was armed with a .357 Magnum revolver, an M-16 machine gun, grenades, and an Uzi machine pistol.

He looked over at his young partner Will Trenton and nodded toward the main street of town in front of them. "We should probably start taking shifts." He let out a frustrated sigh. "There's no way we're going to get any sleep tonight."

Will nodded his agreement. "Okay."
