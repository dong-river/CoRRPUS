Diana Porter stared out the window of her suburban home in upstate New York. She watched her children, Alexander and Violet, play in the driveway with their cousins and their friends. Diana's husband, Evan, was talking to the adults who had arrived for the party.

Diana was forty-two years old and had been a stay-at-home mom for almost twenty years. She wore an off-white dress with two red flowers decorating it. Her long, dark hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail. When she turned away from the window and into the living room, she saw her sister Melissa standing near the front door chatting with one of her neighbors while keeping an eye on Alexander as he played in the yard. Diana looked like an older version of Melissa with shorter hair and rounder features.

Melissa smiled at Diana as she spotted her watching from across the room and made her way over to join her sister in the living room.

"Hey." Melissa embraced Diana before taking a seat on a loveseat next to her sister and resting a hand on top of hers.
