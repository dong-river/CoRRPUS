Jenna Marcoshka is starting to worry. Her daughter, Cathy, was recently diagnosed with a rare disease that has caused her to lose her sight. At first, Cathy was in denial about the fact that she will have to rely on other people for help and may never see again. However, it hasn't been long since Jenna and Mark noticed a change in Cathy's behavior. She started to become more reliant on others for tasks that she previously could handle on her own. When Jenna and Mark confronted her about this change in behavior, she admitted that she didn't know how much longer she would be able to do things for herself. She was extremely worried about what life would be like once she became completely blind.

Jenna tries to comfort Cathy by telling her that things will be fine as long as the family stays together and relies on each other for support throughout this difficult time in their lives.
