Rachel Stephenson was a happy person. She had her best friend, Sarah Mason, her perfect husband, Mark Stephenson, and two perfect children.

She woke up at six every morning. As soon as she got out of bed, she did fifteen minutes of yoga to loosen her muscles and help them relax. After the yoga routine, she went downstairs to make breakfast for herself and her husband. While they ate breakfast in the kitchen, they discussed their plans for the day. After breakfast was done, she headed upstairs to give each of their two kids a bath while Mark took out the trash and checked his email on his computer in the den.

Their kids were like little angels because they never caused any trouble; they were quiet when they were eating; they were always dressed in impeccable outfits when they left the house; and there was no yelling in their household because everyone was kind to one another. They would go out for walks after breakfast but by eight thirty am, Rachel already had her work clothes on as well as her makeup done; at nine am, she was usually working on a canvas or painting at one of three coffee shops that all opened at eight am in Lake Bloomfield, Illinois where she lived with her family.
