Martha Greenwood lives with her husband Harry and her daughter Esther in a small town by a river. Martha has always worked hard for the family, but after many years, she is growing weary of the difficult life she leads. She often pities herself because she cannot do many of the things other mothers do. Harry Greenwood works at an office during the day and then comes home to work in the fields when he gets off work. He also works on their family's garden after he has finished working in the fields. Esther and Martha's life is hard too, but they are used to it and try not to complain too much about it.

Martha wants to do something that will make her more like other mothers who have time for activities with their children. One day she says to Esther, "I wish I could be home more so that we could do more things together."

"You're home now," Esther replies. "We can play!"

Martha knows that even though Esther is home every day from school, her daughter doesn't really have time for a game or two because they both have homework they need to complete before bedtime.
