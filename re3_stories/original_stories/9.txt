Beth Christensen walked into the living room, where her daughter Julie was sitting with her boyfriend Tommy. She could tell that the two were happy and carefree, and she instantly knew that something was up.

"Julie," Beth said sternly. "What's going on?"

"What do you mean?" Julie asked nervously.

"You look too happy for something not to be going on," Beth replied, glaring at Tommy. "Is this about what I think it is?"

Julie turned to Tommy for help, but he remained silent and looked away from her. "I'm pregnant," she said in a low voice after several moments of silence. She started to tear up as she finished speaking. "I'm sorry."

Beth was shocked by what she had just heard. She went to her daughter and pulled her into a hug while scolding Tommy at the same time. "Tommy Foster! What did you do? When did this happen? Why didn't you stop this from happening? You're the one who is supposed to be responsible! Now I have to deal with you and your father's mistakes."
