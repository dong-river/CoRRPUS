George McCarthy lifted his granddaughter from the chair and carried her to her bed. She whimpered softly as he gently placed her under the sheets and stroked her forehead.

"Shhh…it's time for bed, darling," he whispered to the young girl. He switched off the lamp beside the bed and she turned to face him as he leaned over to kiss her goodnight. "You'll be alright, Shannon. We'll take care of you."

She nodded and closed her eyes, drifting into a fitful sleep filled with twisted images of violence and bloodshed; of men who wanted something she didn't understand…or wanted something else entirely...and a man in a mask, looking at her sadly before fading away into nothingness…the same mask that now sat discarded in a box on the floor at George's feet.

He carefully placed it back into the box and took one last look at it before sealing it shut. He glanced over at his wife who was sitting beside Shannon's bed with an arm around their granddaughter as she slept soundly, before turning out the light and heading downstairs to his workshop.

Evelyn rose from Shannon's bed as she heard George descend from their bedroom above.
