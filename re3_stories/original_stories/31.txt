Chase Elliott glanced at his watch as he pulled into his driveway. It was late, but at least he'd gotten the first day of summer vacation off to a good start. Riley Harper had arrived from Chicago that morning and had immediately begun unpacking. From what Chase could tell, she hadn't unpacked much more than a few pieces of clothing and her camera equipment when she decided to take a walk around town. Her new town, where he would soon be training her as his replacement until a permanent sheriff could be found.

It had been an interesting few days since the first visit Riley made to his office at the police station after learning about her father's death. They'd gone to dinner together that night and since then they'd seen each other nearly every day while they settled Riley into their town.

Chase grabbed his briefcase from the passenger seat of his truck and slammed the door shut with his hip before making his way toward the house. He glanced up at the windows, wondering if Riley was in her room. The second story bedroom faced out over the driveway and while he could hear a television blaring through an open window, there was no sign of Riley herself.
