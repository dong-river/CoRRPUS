Owen Murphy checked his watch for the tenth time in five minutes. His daughter, Amelia, was late. Again.

The front door of Murphy's Sports Bar and Grill opened and a girl stepped inside. She was wearing a pair of loose jeans, hiking boots, and a dark blue hoodie. The hood was pulled up over her head. She surveyed the room as she came inside, looking for someone. When she found him, she smiled and waved at Owen before making her way across the room to where he was sitting with a customer at one of the tables in the corner.

"Sorry I'm late," Amelia said when she reached her father's table. "Landon decided to play keep away with my backpack."

Owen sighed heavily and shook his head in frustration. "What did you do to make him mad this time?" He asked, looking at his daughter over the top of his wire-rimmed glasses that were perched on his nose by an elastic band around the frames."I told him he needed to clean up after himself before I would go anywhere with him." Her father grunted and started collecting plates from around their table that held half-eaten burgers that were cold by now.
