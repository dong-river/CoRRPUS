Jason Westfall woke up on a Monday morning. The sun was shining brightly in his window. Jason glanced at the clock. It was 5:30 AM. Jason didn't feel tired. He wanted to play a video game or watch some television, but his mom and dad had told him that he should go back to sleep.

Jason was still thinking about the car accident that happened five days ago, the night before his fourth birthday party. His mother, Joan Westfall, died instantly, but Jason's father and his sister survived without major injuries. The driver of the other car had been intoxicated at the time of the accident, so he was taken to jail for DWI (driving while intoxicated). A grand jury hearing would decide if charges would be filed against him for manslaughter or vehicular homicide for causing the accident that killed Joan Westfall and injured Brent and Ella Westfall.

The biggest thing on Jason's mind today was school.
