Emma Woods knocked on Kaitlyn Tucker's door and waited for her friend to answer. The two were supposed to be studying at Kaitlyn's house, but Emma wanted to chat. The door opened and Kaitlyn appeared.

"Hi Emma, what are you doing here?"

"Do you remember that party I mentioned last week?" Emma said, "Well it's tomorrow night."

"I know," Kaitlyn replied, "Didn't you just tell me a few days ago?"

"Yes," Emma said. "My parents have made up their minds that I am going to the party and they are not changing their minds."

Kaitlyn smiled, "Well let me get my bag and we can study at your house." She turned and hurried into her bedroom. A few moments later she returned with her bag in hand.
