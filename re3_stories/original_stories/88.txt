Jessica Parker stood at the entrance to Sara's apartment, clutching a big blue bag. "This will probably last for a year or so," she said with a chuckle.

"What are you talking about?" Sarah asked, and took the bag from her friend's hands.

"Birthday gifts."

"That won't last a year." Sarah said indignantly, putting the bag on the table in the kitchen. She lifted the lid and peeked inside. "Just see this..." She laughed again and pulled out the twenty pairs of socks that were stuffed in there. Jessica had bought them all of them in different colors and styles, most of them being knee-high socks because they were Sarah's favorite style. There were also four t-shirts (two yellow ones, one white and one black) with cartoons on them as well as two pairs of socks for every day, two pairs for Sundays and for special occasions four t-shirts, four pairs of pants and tops, four pairs of shorts and three skirts with matching sets (pink, red and green). Just in case Sarah would go out some place fancy to eat, Jessica had also packed some elegant shoes (and slippers) as well as high heels.
