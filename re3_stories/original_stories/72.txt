Martha Gentry thought she would feel relief when Robert finally died, but she only felt sad and lonely. He had not been a good husband, but he had always been there for her.

Her husband was a well-known recluse who seldom went out and rarely interacted with other people. She had left him once after an argument, but she missed him so much that she went back to the farm and never left again.

Robert was old when they married. He was in his sixties and Martha was only seventeen years old when they got married. She loved him with all her heart. But as the years passed, he grew increasingly ill-tempered. She had hoped that his death would free her from her unhappy life, but she realized that he had chained her to the place where they lived because of the property he owned, the house he built for them on the farm, and all their furniture inside it. Robert had left Martha alone to care for their place on the farm because he hated it there so much that he preferred to remain away from it as much as possible.
