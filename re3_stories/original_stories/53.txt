Jessica Brown was Jane's best friend since childhood. She was visiting her in her apartment that evening. They were both sitting on the couch, watching TV. Jane had a frown on her face, she was confused and upset about something.

"Jessica," she said, "what's wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong," Jessica replied, though she knew it wasn't true. "Why do you ask?"

"Because you don't look like yourself."

"Oh, sorry. I've been thinking about something."

"What have you been thinking about?" Jane asked, slightly curious as to what her friend had been up to all day while she was out of the apartment. In all honesty, Jane had hardly any close friends other than Jessica; she didn't seem to make many friends during the years of high school and university and was always too shy to start a conversation with anyone else whenever the opportunity presented itself for fear of being rejected. Her only other significant friendship in life came from childhood when she spent almost every day with Jessica who lived next door with her family.
