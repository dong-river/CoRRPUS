Gabe McCarthy looked at his sister, who was sitting at the kitchen table sorting their dad's old mail. He got up and walked over to her.

"Hey, Jen," he said. "I don't think I can do this anymore."

Jenna looked up from the mail and smiled sadly at her little brother. She patted his head and sighed heavily, sinking into her chair a little further. The paper crinkled in her hands and she pushed it away impatiently. She needed to think about something else; the situation with their father was too much for both of them to deal with right now. She turned to Gabe and gestured for him to sit beside her. He did so, even though he wanted to stay standing to show how serious he was being right now.
