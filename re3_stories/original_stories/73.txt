Lucas Darnell snuck back into his house. He had been gone all night, and he was pretty sure his mom would be asleep. The sun was just beginning to rise over the horizon, so it was still pretty dark outside. Lucas reached up to his bed and pulled down the shoebox he had hidden there.

Lucas thought that at age twelve he had finally figured out how things worked in the world. He believed that as soon as he could understand how something worked, and as soon as he found something he wanted, it would become available to him. And now, for the first time since he had discovered his gift a few years earlier, Lucas Darnell had finally been able to get what he wanted: an extra hour in the day.

On a seemingly ordinary day about three years ago, Lucas wandered away from where the other children were playing kickball in his school yard. His mind began working on a question that he had not been able to figure out before: if we sleep eight hours a night and do four hours of homework per day (a conservative estimate), how many extra hours are left in our days?
