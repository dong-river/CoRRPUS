James Walters was sitting in his police cruiser. It was late at night and he was parked in front of the Bell family estate. He'd received a call about a breaking and entering at the house, but so far nothing had happened. The doors were all still closed, and nothing seemed to be disturbed. Walters tapped his fingers against the steering wheel and tried to stay awake as he glanced up at the dark house. He was surprised it hadn't already been boarded up for good considering no one had lived there for decades.

What could be worth stealing from this place?

He checked his watch. It was late, nearly midnight. Normally he would have been home long ago with his wife, but they'd gotten into an argument earlier that evening and Rebecca had stormed out on him. It hadn't ended well, like most arguments lately. She was frustrated with him because he couldn't seem to stay on top of things at work; lately he'd been showing up late and getting angry with people in uniform that weren't even there fault. They had found a new case earlier that day: a missing person that no one even seemed to notice was gone.
