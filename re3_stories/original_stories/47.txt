Maxine Carter looked over at her latest hire, Shannon Burke, with a puzzled expression. Shannon had a wild look in her eyes as she paced back and forth across the floor of Maxine's office. She kept checking her watch while jumping up every so often to peek through the blinds at the news station beyond. Maxine found it difficult to understand why this woman was so edgy when they were due to start filming in a few minutes. It wasn't like she was an inexperienced intern. For that matter, it wasn't like she hadn't been out on assignments before.

"Okay, Shan," said Maxine breaking into the young woman's monologue of nervous babble. "What's the big deal? The camera is in position and everything is ready to go."

Shannon whipped around with a surprised look on her face and smiled broadly at Maxine as if suddenly realizing where she was. "Oh! Right!" She laughed nervously. "Sorry, Max."

Maxine smiled but did not respond to Shannon's apology or explanation for her strange behavior. The woman needed no prompting to continue where she had left off moments before. "I have been thinking about what you said about your reporting strategy for this case."
