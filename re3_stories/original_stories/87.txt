Jürgen Meier, age twenty-two, heard a sound and turned his head. He saw a brunette walking toward him with a small package in her hand.

"Hello," she said. "Are you Jürgen Meier?"

He nodded. "Yes, I am."

"I'm here to deliver this package for you," she said. She handed him the package and then took out a little notebook from her bag. "Sign here please."

He signed it without even looking at it first. The woman gave him a cute smile before turning around and walking away. He watched her until she was gone and then turned back to the condo he was working on building with his team of builders. Even though they weren't part of any official guild, they had all banded together to learn the art of building condos like this one and work together to build one each year or so just for fun in their spare time.
