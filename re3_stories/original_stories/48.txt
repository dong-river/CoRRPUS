Richard Kane is a very successful businessman. He owns many restaurants and businesses all over the city, bringing in millions of dollars in revenue every year. But business alone cannot satisfy Richard. He has a strong thirst for the thrill of the game and enjoys gambling, always striving to push his luck with each new venture.

Richard is married to Olivia Kane, a beautiful woman who never failed to meet his high expectations. Olivia was always stylish and popular, but she married into money, which made her even more popular among the upper class of society. Despite their wealth and popularity, Richard and Olivia wanted children, which would ensure that they passed on their status into the next generation. They spent several years trying to conceive but were unable to do so until one day, Olivia became pregnant. A son was born first but died shortly after birth. It was only then that a daughter came along two years later; but this child also did not survive past infancy despite their desperate efforts to save her life.

Despite these crushing losses and failing health for both of them, Olivia loved her husband dearly despite his weaknesses for gambling and foolish risks in business dealings.
