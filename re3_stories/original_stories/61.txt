Grace Walsh steps out of the car and looks at her house. "It's in shambles!" she yells at her husband, Brendan.

"You can't expect me to fix everything on one trip home from work, Grace."

"Why didn't you tell me it was in such bad shape?" she asks angrily. "I had no idea we were this bad off." Grace is trying not to cry because of all the work she needs to do. When they got married, they had a modest wedding, and did not use their savings for a honeymoon. Instead, they put it away for their first child's college fund. Their daughter was born a year later than planned and Grace left her career as an event planner so that she could stay home with her child until college. Now with their savings almost gone, Brendan wanted to buy a new laptop with the money instead of repairing the house they've lived in for two decades. Her husband is just as much at fault as their daughter; he always loved his laptop more than fixing things around the house so why should she be surprised? She thought about returning it to him but Mallory would definitely notice when her parents are suddenly gone for days on end and would ask where they went.
