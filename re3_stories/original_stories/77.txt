Porter Haggerty pulled the crumpled paper from his jacket pocket and checked the name on it for the hundredth time. He had it memorized by now, but he was still a little nervous about the task ahead of him. He unfolded the piece of paper and stared at the words written in black ink:

Mr. Haggerty,

I'm writing to inform you that your application for a journalist's position has been accepted. We believe that you are perfect for the role, which will include front-page coverage of current events and investigative reports in addition to producing several pieces each week. This is an incredible opportunity to put your ideas into practice, so I hope you will consider it carefully before making your decision. As this position would be based in the United States, we must insist that you relocate as soon as possible to ensure that you are available at all times. Once we have your commitment, we can go ahead with any administrative matters necessary to complete your paperwork so that you can start work immediately.

Congratulations again on securing such an exciting position with our organization!

Sincerely, Dr. Lewis Jones (CEO)
