Olivia Dupree is now 5 years old. Her mother Amanda died suddenly five years ago, and she was left in the care of her godmother Payton.

"Hiya, Livie!" Payton calls from the hallway of her apartment. "Is your homework done?"

"I'm playing a game," Olivia yells back to her. "Come on in!"

Payton smiles and enters the living room. Olivia is sitting cross-legged on the floor with an iPad propped up on a pillow. She grins up at Payton and waves. "Hello!" she says cheerfully. "What have you been doing today?"

"Not much," Payton says, bending down to hug Olivia and steal a kiss on her cheek. She sits down beside her niece and kisses her forehead tenderly before ruffling her hair. "I had a lot of work to do at the office today."

"I want to go there sometime," Olivia tells her seriously, putting down the iPad and reaching for a toy purse instead.
