Karen Hanson sat in the kitchen of her home and wondered if there was anything that could snap her out of her depression. She had just lost her husband, and it seemed as if everything she had ever known was gone. Lettie, her mother, was also suffering from grief because she had lost the one person she loved more than anything else in the world.

Lettie would have been one hundred years old next week. She had lived a long life, but Bob's death felt like the last thing left to live for. Lettie cried often, especially when Karen took Andrew and Robbie to visit their graves every Sunday.

That morning Karen woke up to see that it was a beautiful day outside, as usual. It always seemed as if the sky above their town was unendingly blue with white puffy clouds floating around in it. They rarely got rainy days or snowy days; there never seemed to be any threat of harsh weather at all. This perfect weather only served to make Lettie feel even worse about how everything worked out for them both being alive without Bob.

Karen felt herself sink into despair every time she looked out of her window and realized how awful life was without Bob there to share it with them all.
