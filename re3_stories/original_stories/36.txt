Julia Fletcher knocks on the door to her sister's hospital room. Karen answers the door, having just come out of the bathroom.

"Oh good, you're up. The doctor said you could go home today," Julia says, hugging her sister.

"That's great news. I was beginning to feel like a prisoner in here," Karen says. "Although I'm glad they took care of my daughter."

"They took care of your daughter?" Julia asks. "The one who's dead?"

Karen gasps and holds her stomach, grimacing with pain as she collapses on the bed, tears streaming down her face. "She's dead? She died?" she cries. "What happened? Was it a car accident?"

"I'm so sorry, Karen," Julia says as she sits on the bed next to her sister and pulls her into a hug. "No one told you yet? You must have been asleep when they came and told me." Her voice catches in her throat as she realizes what happened while Karen was asleep.
