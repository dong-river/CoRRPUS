Jillian Riley always wanted to be a writer. Her husband, Robert, had always been an artist at heart. When they married and began their life together, they believed they would both achieve their dreams.

Instead, Robert lived his life vicariously through his wife's stories and articles. He died before he had the chance to be published himself.

Jillian's first story was published in a national newspaper shortly after his death. She took on part-time work as a sales assistant at a small bookshop to help support herself and her daughter.

With money tight, Jillian relied on her writing skills to pay for Shannon's education and living expenses. She taught Shannon how to appreciate the printed word and provided a broad range of reading material, from romance novels to classics such as Shakespeare and Dickens. As Shannon grew older, she began writing her own stories for her mother to read each night before bedtime.

The story is set in a small city in New England where an exciting artistic environment exists beside an old mill that was converted into shops selling various art supplies.
